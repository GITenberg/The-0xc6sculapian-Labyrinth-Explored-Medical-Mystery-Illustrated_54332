<p>The solemnity of your somniferous aspects, no less

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TO_THE_PHYSICIAN">TO THE PHYSICIAN.</h2>


<p>Having passed the tedious years of abstruse study and intense
application, necessary to your initiation in the mysteries
of physic, and replete with a perfect remembrance of all the
requisites to this <em>great art</em>, we suppose you recently emerged
from the obscurity of <em>dreary walls</em> and <em>dull professors</em>, a phenomænon
of universal knowledge and <em>family</em> admiration. The various
and elaborate examinations you have passed, with scholastic
approbation, having relieved you from the constantly accumulating
load of anxiety, you are at length launched into life under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
a new character, and daily pant to display the dignity of your
profession, in the happy appendage of <em>M. D.</em> to the prescriptive
initials of your name.</p>

<p>You are no longer to be considered a student labouring in the
heavy trammels of <em>unintelligible</em> lectures upon <em>philosophy</em>, <em>anatomy</em>,
<em>botany</em>, <em>chemistry</em>, and the <em>materia medica</em>, with all their distinct and
consequent advantages; or investigating the actual properties of
<em>electrical fire</em> and <span class="smcap">MAGNETIC ENTHUSIASM</span>, but stamped (by royal
authority) with the full force of physical agency, and have derived
from your <em>merit</em> unlimited permission to <em>cure</em>, “<em>kill</em> or <em>destroy</em>,”
to the best of your knowledge and abilities, “so help you
“God.” The professional path you now begin to tread, is so replete
with danger, and the probability of success so very uncertain,
that the fertile world have not omitted to make it proverbial,
“A physician never begins to get bread, till he has no
“teeth to eat it.” The truth of this may perhaps have been <em>lamentingly</em>
acknowledged by some of the most <em>learned men</em> that ever
became dependant upon a <em>capricious</em> world for <em>precarious</em> subsistance.</p>

<p>This palpable fact may concisely serve to convince you, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
embarkation (with all its alluring prospects) will not only be encumbered
with difficulties, but your ultimate gratification of success
exceedingly doubtful. Great depth of learning may afford
consolation to the equity of your own feelings (if you fortunately
possess them) but it is by no means necessary to the acquisition of
<em>public opinion</em>, however it may tend to contribute to the general
good.</p>

<p>To avoid entering into a sentimental disquisition upon the <em>honesty</em>,
<em>integrity</em>, or <em>strict propriety</em> of the maxims I proceed to lay
down for your future conduct to obtain professional splendour, and
<em>insure success</em>; I avail myself of the privilege I possess, to wave
every consideration of the <em>conscientious kind</em>, and once more observe
(without adverting to their consistency) they are adduced only as
the unavoidable traits of character, and modes of behaviour, by
which alone (in the present age) you can possibly hope for the
least proportional share of practice as a physician.</p>

<p>At your first public entré, when the college list and court calendar
have announced your qualifications and advancement to the
wondering world (that such list should annually increase) let your
friends and relatives be doubly assiduous in propagating reports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
(almost incredible) of your <em>great humanity</em>, <em>extensive abilities</em>, and
<em>unbounded benevolence</em>.—This will answer the intended purpose to a
certainty; crouds of the afflicted and necessitous will surround
your habitation, and render your place of residence constantly remarkable
to all classes, who naturally enquiring the character of
the proprietor, will eagerly extol your charity in contributing your
“advice to the poor <span class="smcap">GRATIS</span>.”</p>

<p>This method alone will gain you popularity with those that
rank in the line of mediocrity; with <em>their superiors</em>, success must
be insured more from the efforts of <em>interest</em>, than either <em>personal
merit</em>, or <em>sound policy</em>. Your attention to the wants of the poor,
must soon be regulated by the preponderation of more weighty
considerations; as you <em>affected</em> to alleviate their distresses from the
motive of commiseration, prompting you to promote <em>their ease</em>,
you have an undoubted right to shake off such superfluous visits,
to secure <em>your own</em>. In this deceptive charity, some degree of discrimination
must be put in practice, for you will sometimes perceive
one among the train, whose apparel or behaviour must necessarily
give you reason to suspect he has assumed the cloak of
necessity to save <em>his fee</em>, and avail himself of your professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
liberality in such case, call to your aid a look of true <em>medical austerity</em>,
and let him understand “advice is seldom of any value or
“effect unless it is paid for;” this will frequently answer the purpose,
and procure what you did not expect.</p>

<p>On the contrary, so soon as you observe your prescriptions have
“<em>worked wonders</em>” upon two or three of the most <em>credulous</em> and
<em>superstitious</em>, who are extolling your <em>great knowledge</em> and “blessing
<em>your honour</em>,” strengthen the <em>force</em> of your judgment by <em>charitably
obtruding</em> a pecuniary corroboration into the hand of your
afflicted patient, as a confirmation of your <em>unbounded skill</em> in the
(<em>miraculous</em>) cure of every disease to which the human frame is incident.
By such <em>political</em> practice, you insure the recital of your
services with extacy, and your name reverberates from one end
of the metropolis to the other.</p>

<p>Your person and place of residence, being by these means universally
known, and your name become in a proportional degree
popular, let your plan and mode of behaviour be instantly changed;
it will be now necessary</p>

<p>
“You “assume a” hurry “if you have it not,”<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Take care to be so exceedingly engaged with patients of the <em>first
class and eminence</em>, that “it is with difficulty you procure time sufficient
for the common purposes and gratifications of nature.”
No paupers <em>whatever</em> can be admitted to your presence without a
written recommendation from <em>nobility</em>, or characters of the <em>first
fortune</em>; this will insure you no farther intrusion from a class originally
introduced for your <em>particular purpose</em>; that effected, they
may now be permitted to fall into the back ground of the picture;
from whence they were brought for no other motive than
the promotion of your personal interest and professional emolument.</p>

<p>It becomes your particular care to be always in a <em>hurry</em>; let your
chariot (if you can fortunately raise one) <em>upon job</em>, be at the door
regularly by nine in the morning; to prove how very much you
are attached to the duties of your profession, and how anxiously
you have the <em>salubrity</em> of your patients <em>at heart</em>.—Omit no one
circumstance that can contribute to a shew of being perpetually
engaged. Letters written by <em>yourself</em>, and messengers of your
<em>own dispatching</em>, cannot be seen at your doors too frequently; the
chariot should be as repeatedly ordered—remember to leave home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
by <em>one way</em>, and return by <em>another</em>, and equally <em>in haste</em>; all these
stratagems are considered peculiar privileges of the <em>College of Wigs</em>,
and are well worthy your attention and constant practice. You
need hardly be told, the superficial and unthinking part of mankind
are ever caught by appearances; what proportion they bear
to other distinctions, need not in the present instance be at all ascertained.</p>

<p>Having laid down rules (that should be rigidly persevered in)
for the regulation of your <em>public character</em>, I shall now advert to
the strict line of conduct it will be proper for you to adopt in
your personal transactions upon all professional emergencies.</p>

<p>When called to a patient upon the recommendation of the
family apothecary, you are to consider him one of your best friends,
and <em>pay court to him</em> accordingly; on the contrary, if you are engaged
upon the spontaneous opinion of the patient, or his relatives,
you have every reason to conclude the abilities of the
apothecary are held in very slender estimation, and you may safely
venture to display as much of your <em>own consequence</em> and superiority,
as circumstances will admit.</p>

<p>After the awkward ceremony of your first appearance is over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and matters a little adjusted, take great care to be upon your
guard; indulge in a variety of <em>significant gestures</em>, and <em>emphatical
hems!</em>—and <em>hahs!</em> proving you possessed of <em>singularities</em>, that may
tend to excite ideas in the patient and surrounding friends, that
<em>a physician</em> is a superior part of the creation.——Let <em>every action</em>,
<em>every word</em>, <em>every look</em>, be strongly marked, denoting doubt and
ambiguity; proceed to the necessary enquiries of “what has been
done in rule and regimen, previous to your being called in?”
hear the recital with patience, and give your <em>nod of assent</em>, lest
you make Mr. Emetic, the apothecary, your formidable enemy,
who will then <em>most conscientiously</em> omit to recommend the assistance
of such <em>extraordinary abilities</em> on any future occasion.—Take care to
<em>look wisdom</em> in every feature; speak but little, and let it be impossible
<em>that little</em> should be understood; let every hint, every <em>shrug</em> be
carefully calculated to give the hearers a wonderful opinion of your
learning and experience.—In your <em>half-heard</em> and mysterious conversation
with your <em>medical inferior</em>, do not forget to drop a few
observations upon—“the animal œconomy”—“circulation of the
blood”—“acrimony”—“the non naturals”—“stricture upon
the parts”—“acute pain”—“inflammatory heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>”—“nervous
irritability,” and all those <em>technical traps</em> that fascinate the
hearers, and render the patient yours ad libitum.</p>

<p>To the friends or relatives of the diseased, (as the case may be)
you seriously apprehend <em>great danger</em>; but such apprehension is
not without its portion of <em>hope</em>; and you doubt not, but a rigid
perseverance in the plan you shall prescribe, will reconcile all difficulties
in a few days, and restore the patient (whose recovery you
have exceedingly at heart) to his health and friends; that you will
embrace the earliest opportunity to see him again, most probably
at such an hour, (naming it) in the mean time you are in a great
degree happy to leave him in such good hands as <em>Mr. Emetic</em>, to
whom you shall give every necessary direction, and upon whose
<em>integrity</em> and <em>punctuality</em> you can implicitly rely.</p>

<p>You then require a private apartment for your necessary consultation
and plan of <em>joint depredation</em> upon the pecuniary property
of your unfortunate invalid, which you are now going <em>seriously</em> to
attack with the full force of <em>physic</em> and <em>finesse</em>. You first learn from
your informant what has been hitherto done without effect, and
determine accordingly how to proceed; but in this, great respect
must be paid to the temper, as well as the constitution and cir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>cumstances,
of your intended <em>prey</em>; if he be of a petulant and refractory
disposition, submitting to medical dictation upon absolute
compulsion, as a professed enemy to physic and the faculty, let
your harvest be <em>short</em>, and complete as possible. On the contrary,
should a <em>hypochondriac</em> be your subject, with the long train of melancholic
doubts, fears, hopes, and despondencies, avail yourself
of the faith implicitly placed in you, and regulate your proceedings
by the force of <em>his imagination</em>; let your prescription (by
its length and variety) reward your <em>jackall</em> for his present attention
and future services.—Take care to furnish the frame so amply
with <em>physic</em>, that <em>food</em> may be unnecessary; let every hour (or two)
have its destined appropriation—render all possible forms of the
<em>materia medica</em> subservient to the general good—<em>draughts</em>—<em>powders</em>—<em>drops</em>,
and <em>pills</em>, may be given (at least) every two hours; intervening
<em>apozems</em>, or <em>decoctions</em>, may have their utility; if no other
advantage is to be expected, one good will be clearly ascertained,
the convenience of having the <em>nurse</em> kept constantly awake, and
if <em>one medicine</em> is not productive of success, <em>another may</em>. These are
surely alternatives well worthy your attention, being admirably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
calculated for the promotion of your <em>patient’s cure</em> and your <em>own
reputation</em>.</p>

<p>Having written your long prescription, and learnt from Mr.
Emetic every necessary information, you return to the room of
your patient, to prove your attention, and renew your admonitions
of punctuality and submission;—then receiving your <em>fee</em>
with a consequential <em>air of indifference</em>, you take your leave; not
omitting to drop an additional assurance, that “you shall not be
<em>remiss</em> in your attendance.” These, Sir, are the instructions you
must steadily pursue, if you possess an ardent desire to become
<em>eminent</em> in your <em>profession</em>—<em>opulent</em> in your <em>circumstances</em>—<em>formidable</em>
to your <em>competitors</em>, or a <em>valuable practitioner</em> to the <em>Company</em> of <em>Apothecaries</em>,
from whom you are to expect the foundation of support.
A multiplicity of additional hints might be added for your minute
observance; but such a variety will present themselves in the course
of practice, that a retrospective view of diurnal occurrences will
sufficiently furnish you with every possible information for your
future progress; regulating your behaviour, by the rank of your
patients, from the <em>most</em> pompous <em>personal ostentation</em>, to the meanest
and <em>most contemptible servility</em>.</p>

<hr class="chap" /></div>
<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>




<h2 class="nobreak" id="TO_THE_SURGEON">TO THE SURGEON.</h2>


<p>I congratulate you upon your recent emancipation from
incessant study, intense application, and strict <em>hospital</em> attendance,
where I shall willingly
 suppose, you was a <em>dresser</em> of the
most promising abilities; that you excelled your cotemporaries in
every <em>chirurgical</em> opinion, became an expert <em>dissecting</em> pupil to one
of the <em>court of examiners</em>, and are now burst through the cloud of
your original obscurity, a perfect prodigy of <em>anatomical</em> disquisition.</p>

<p>I naturally conclude you capable of animadverting upon all the
distinct branches of your art to admiration, that you are critically
excellent in the use of an <em>instrument</em> from the humble act of simple
<em>phlebotomy</em>, to the more important operation for a <em>fistula in ano</em>.—You
have, beyond every shadow of doubt, paid proper attention
to the fashionable precepts of the late Lord Chesterfield, and
rendered yourself (with assistance from the graces) a perfect adept
in polite address, displaying a variety of the most engaging attitudes,
even in the adjustment of a <em>ten tailed bandage</em>. The pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>fessional
information you have industriously collected, is such as will
certainly afford you the most equitable claims upon <em>public opinion</em>,
being in possession of every necessary acquisition from a <em>simple
gonorrhœa</em> to a <em>confirmed lues</em>.</p>

<p>Previous to your solicitation of favour from your friends, you
have necessarily passed the awful ceremony of examination at the
<em>Old Bailey</em>, under your former tutor (and his brethren of the
court) who would not pay his <em>own abilities</em> so improper a compliment
as to ask you questions in <em>anatomy</em> or <em>osteology</em>, that he knew
your qualifications inadequate to the task of technically explaining.
After passing this <em>fiery ordeal</em>, you deposit the usual <em>pecuniary gratuity</em>,
and receiving the <em>badge</em> of your newly acquired <em>honor</em>, we
now hail you “<em>a Member of the Corporation of Surgeons</em>,” and conclude
an ornamental plate upon the door of your habitation denotes
you so accordingly.</p>

<p>We suppose you embarking in a sea of spirited opposition, with
your competitors, for professional celebrity, and decorating your
place of residence in the most applicable stile to attract attention.
To effect this, let your exterior apartments be ornamented with
the <em>busts</em> of <em>ancients</em> you <em>never read</em>, and <em>portraits</em> of <em>moderns</em> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
you <em>never knew</em>. These form an excellent combination to excite
the admiration and report of those who have occasion to court the
assistance of your extensive abilities.—To gradually heighten
which surprize, your interior (or <em>audit room</em>) must be a perfect
<em>Golgotha</em>.—A proficiency in the science of <em>osteology</em>, must be powerfully
impressed upon the senses of the trembling visitors, by a
<em>profusion</em> of <em>skeletons</em> in different states; let the awfulness of the
scene be rendered still more striking, by a variety of subjects
suspended in spirits, interspersed with singular <em>anatomical and injected
preparations</em>, both wet and dry; giving to the whole additional
force by the introduction of a “<em>few ill shaped fishes</em>,” as
the finishing stroke to a well formed plan of <em>chirurgical ostentation</em>.
Remember to let the <em>certificates</em> of your professional qualifications,
from your different <em>lecturing tutors</em>, be so placed (in elegant frames)
as to meet the eye in a conspicuous direction; lest that part of
your patients, who condescend to visit you in this gloomy recess,
should have reason to conclude you a <em>consummate dunce</em> and most
<em>illiterate booby</em>, if these learned professors had not done your friends
the favour to “<em>certify</em>” to the contrary: and this they always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
<em>chearfully</em> do, rather than have it imagined they have eased you of
a part of your property, without doing you any <em>real service</em>.</p>

<p>The domestic arrangement being thus formed, the reflections
to which you must now turn your mind, are the necessary modes
of practice and behaviour, that may render you not only eminent
in your profession, but respectable in your property; as great
events, that contribute largely to the gratification of such wish, do
not frequently occur, inferior cases of every kind must be rendered
subservient to the purpose. In this list, <em>venereals</em> are entitled
to pre-eminence, as the most lucrative; the patient never hesitating
to pay full as liberally for the preservation of the <em>secret</em> as the cure
of <em>disease</em>.—But you may be perfectly assured, this secret never
rewards so well, as when <em>fate</em> or <em>fortune</em> assists its introduction to
<em>married families</em>; a most striking corroboration of this fact, occurred
not long since in the neighbourhood of a <em>royal residence</em>,
and afforded matter of mirth to the first circles in its environs.—This
constant friend to the faculty was communicated to a married
lady, by a <em>young</em> and celebrated personage of some national
eminence, and immediately conveyed from her to her <em>enamoured
cornuto</em> in the moments of true <em>connubial felicity</em>; he, in the love of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
variety, unluckily conferred the favour upon the <em>house maid</em>; and
she, in the extensive liberality of her disposition, kindly bestowed
a portion upon the <em>footman</em>. The <em>electrical shock</em> of this <em>French fire</em>
was so rapidly communicated, that the four sufferers, within the
space of ten days, made their separate <em>private</em> confessions to the
medical superintendant of the family, each assigning a different
cause for its introduction, and equally strangers to the <em>mode</em> of
its being brought into so <em>sober a family</em>. Although this is a well
authenticated <em>fact</em>, it is a harvest that can be very seldom expected
to happen in so great a degree; yet you will find it a matter often
<em>intruding</em> between husband and wife, and considered no indelible
proof of <em>modern inconstancy</em>.—To this secret, you will be frequently
admitted by one party—the other, or both; and have an
undoubted privilege to accumulate all possible pecuniary advantage
from the confidence so implicitly placed in you.</p>

<p>Whatever cases are submitted to your opinion, be always prepared
to represent them <em>worse</em> than they really <em>are</em>; making by
your technical terms, and political doubts, <em>bad worse</em> upon every
possible occasion. Let all your proceedings have a peculiar and
commanding dignity annexed to the execution; by assuming a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
want of feeling, even to <em>ferocity</em>, you will be termed a practitioner
of <em>spirit</em>, and become properly distinguished for your professional
<em>fortitude</em>. No tender sensations must be permitted to influence
your feelings during any operation, however tedious, or
painful to the patient; they are an ornament to human nature,
and beneath your consideration <em>as one of the faculty</em>.—Custom has
rendered you ineligible to a place in the <em>jury box</em>, as an evident
proof of your professional <em>brutality</em>; by therefore turning “their
pains to laughter and contempt,” you only justify the character
you are already in possession of.</p>

<p>In the most trifling operations (even phlebotomy) descend to
the very minutiæ of medical consequence, not only making the
ceremony <em>long</em>, but <em>serious</em>, that you may be the better entitled to
personal respect and pecuniary compensation. In all those dreadful
accidents that alarm friends and distress families, take care to
throw out (during your apparent care and attention) a variety of
observations that convey <em>large sounds</em> with <em>little meaning</em>; by such
ambiguous expressions you render the cure more extraordinary,
whenever it happens, and is no bad preparative for the procrastination
of it to your own emolument. In all cases requiring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
interposition of instruments, take great care that you produce
them with mysterious solemnity, impressing the spectators and
assistants, with equal <em>awe</em> and <em>fear</em> of your abilities; if <em>incisions</em>,
or <em>separation</em> of the <em>soft parts</em>, become necessary, be sure, like “old
Renault,” to “shed blood enough;” it will be attended with a
double advantage; first in the appearance of business, and the
more <em>pleasing consideration</em>, that the <em>larger</em> and <em>deeper</em> the wound,
the longer time will be necessary for <em>incarnation</em>; during the course
of which, your personal attendance and daily <em>epithemas</em> cannot be
dispensed with.</p>

<p>The <em>greater operations</em> do not occur every day, therefore tedious
<em>cicatrizations</em>, in addition to <em>simple</em> and <em>compound fractures</em>, are
comfortable aids to fill up the spaces of intervention. Fractures
of the <em>lower extremities</em> are exceedingly favourable, for you may
then exert proper authority; it becomes your duty to keep <em>them
down</em> when they <em>are so</em>, for surely you may take upon you to know
(with propriety and professional privilege) when they are capable
of <em>standing</em> and <em>walking</em>, better than they can <em>themselves</em>.—Tho’
one exception to this rule has fallen within my knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
and nearly set aside the privilege of the practice in the neighbourhood
where it happened.</p>

<p>An honest hearty <em>miller</em>, in a small parish in the county of
H———, having, on the market day, made some lucky purchases,
and congratulating himself upon his good fortune with a few
friends over the bottle, got himself insensibly intoxicated; but
obstinately persisting in his determination (and ability) to ride
home, he was suffered to depart, and was found afterwards upon
the road by one of his own servants almost lifeless; he was conveyed
to his habitation, and one of the most <em>eminent surgeons</em> from
a certain large and populous town was called in, who finding
the trunk nearly inanimate, proceeded to <em>venesection</em>, then to an
accurate examination of the body, in which he presently discovered
“a <em>fracture of the tibia</em>, and two of the ribs; he had every
reason to apprehend (from present symptoms) a <em>concussion of the
brain</em>; but situated as things were, he should now administer
proper <em>palliatives</em>, and pursue the necessary steps upon his arrival
in the morning.”—He then left the patient, after strict
injunctions “that he should not be suffered to move from the
position he had placed him in, till his return.”—At the hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
before appointed, the <em>Doctor</em> returned, and not finding the wife
below stairs, explored the region he had left his patient in the
night before, surrounded by his sorrowful friends; when, strange
to relate! (<em>stranger to believe!</em>) the bird was flown, the bed made,
and the very room exhibited a striking proof of rustic neatness.
Recovering in some degree from his surprise, and feeling <em>very forcibly</em>
the aukwardness of his situation, he descended to the kitchen,
and there finding the wife (who had just returned from some business
in a back yard) he eagerly enquired “How, or which way,
his patient had been conveyed, and where to?”—When the
poor woman very simply and civilly replied, that “her husband
was gone into the fields among his folks; that she had repeatedly
urged the doctor’s orders of his <em>not getting out of bed</em>; but
he was a very obstinate man, and said he’d be d—’d if he’d
ever lay in bed with a <em>broken leg</em> for any doctor in England, so
long as he could walk upon it.”—It may be better conceived
than described how severe a stroke this proved upon the reputation
of the surgeon; certain it is, his practice continued in a declining
state for some years, and it was not till the circumstance
was nearly buried in oblivion (with the body of the miller) that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
he recovered his former celebrity, being at this moment one of
the oldest and most eminent practitioners in the neighbourhood
where he resides.</p>

<p>This instance sufficiently demonstrates the impropriety of overstraining
the professional prerogative, especially with those obstinate
uncivilized beings, who have so little pliability of disposition,
as not to lay in bed when required; particularly in cases of emergency,
where it is so evidently for the promotion of their own
health and safety.</p>

<p>Remember in all cases of difficulty and danger to be mindful of
the <em>emplastrum adhæsivum</em> of connexion, by which every branch of
the faculty should be united for the preservation of the whole;
advise (without the least reference to the enormity of expence) a
consultation of the most eminent; this renders the case of your patient
more serious and alarming, and you oblige your brethren by
the recommendation; first of a physician, whose <em>prescription</em> introduces
the <em>apothecary</em>; and you then proceed <em>physically</em> and <em>systematically</em>
in the joint depredation and cure; your two friends, by the
law of retribution, gratefully recommending your inspection of
every simple <em>laceration</em> upon all similar occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>These are maxims that may at first sight seem beneath the attention
of a young and <em>brilliant</em> practitioner, who erroneously conceiving
<em>merit</em> a sufficient recommendation, requires no other conductor;
but they are so evidently an absolute part of his necessary
study, that unless such <em>mutual arts</em> are occasionally put in
practice, he can never (in the present multiplied state of practitioners)
expect to derive the common necessaries of life from a fair
and generous practice of his profession.</p>

<p>Men of understanding, experience, and observation, know, that
the benignant hand of providence continues to anticipate in a variety
of instances the interpositions of <em>art</em>; and <em>nature</em> would,
upon many occasions, entirely effect her own work, if not so frequently
interrupted and retarded by the officious hands and interested
experiments of professional jugglers.</p>

MAN-MIDWIFE.</h2>


<p>You fortunately make your appearance upon the boards of
public patronage, under the most striking advantages; the
prevalence of <em>fashion</em> has exceeded every consideration of <em>decency</em>
and <em>discretion</em>, and you are become (by the influence of pride and
imitation) as necessary to the comfort of a cottage, as the happiness
of a court. From the nature of your professional destination,
a pleasing exterior, and an accomplished person, are invariably
expected; necessarily blending (from your intended intercourse
with the <em>purer</em> part of the creation) the precision of taste, with the
perfection of the scholar.</p>

<p>The certificate granted you by that elaborate lecturer, the <em>obstetric
professor</em>, proclaims you qualified in the very minutiæ of this
mysterious art. The parts, externally and internally, necessary to
generation, are so perfectly familiar to your “mind’s eye,” that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
you can extemporaneously delineate the <em>ovariæ</em>, the “<em>fallopian</em>
tubes,” the <em>fimbriæ</em>, and the very act of <em>conception</em>, from the
“<em>animalculæ</em>” in “<em>semen masculino</em>,” to the last stage of <em>gestation</em>;
the gradual expansion of the <em>uterus</em>, the dilatation of the <em>os uteri</em>,
the progress of <em>labour</em>, and all the methods of extraction.</p>

<p>You can clearly define the classes as <em>natural</em>, <em>laborious</em>, and <em>preternatural</em>;
the use of the <em>forceps</em>, <em>scissars</em>, <em>crotchet</em>, and <em>blunt hook</em>;
the introduction of the <em>catheter</em>, the extraction of the <em>placenta</em>, and
the separation of the <em>funis</em>; in fact, all the <em>et ceteras</em> are so perfectly
clear to you in <em>theory</em>, that it is almost treason to suppose
you can <em>err</em> in the practice.</p>

<p>But, Sir, ripe as you are in these advantages, the harvest of universal
applause, and the sweets of emolument, are scarcely to be
acquired even by time, labour, and the most indefatigable industry.
You have in the practice of <em>midwifery</em>, all the ills of <em>Pandora’s box</em>
to encounter, and after twenty years practice may be left to exclaim
most emphatically,</p>

<p>
“Vain his attempt who strives to please you all.”<br />
</p>

<p>The only consolation you have, is, that you are destined to co<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>operate
with subjects, whose smiles render some degree of compensation
for the incessant fatigue dependant upon the practice.
Under these considerations, in the full career of your expectations,
it can never prove inapplicable to prepare your mind for
some of the rebuffs and disappointments that inevitably ensue. I
conclude you are possessed of youth, health, diligence, and constitutional
<em>stamina</em>; but there are other requisites, equally necessary
for the performance of professional duties, to which by
election you dedicate the store of knowledge you have so industriously
acquired. The indispensible qualifications, for the successful
execution of the arduous task you are undertaking, may be
comprised in very few words, and those few exceedingly expressive
and readily understood; without <em>sobriety</em>, <em>fortitude</em>, <em>judgment</em>,
and <em>patience</em>, you never can expect to attain the summit of excellence,
or obtain admission to those families whose patronage will
contribute most to both credit and emolument. But admitting
you possessed of all the requisites for mere manual operation, the
process of delivery, and consistency of conduct, yet there are a
multiplicity of embellishments, that nothing but previous inform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>ation,
private instruction, or experimental practice, can sufficiently
recommend to your attention.</p>

<p>In the awful minute of your introduction to a scene of excruciating
agony and eager expectation, where the hope of a mother,
and the anxiety of friends, all center in you, as the messenger
of peace, throw off the ostentatious air of self-importance,
exerted over those <em>patient paupers</em> upon whom you practised in
the days of your initiation, and recollecting yourself the humble
solicitant of public opinion and private favour, display your tenderness
and civility, as no bad harbinger of your better qualifications.
Strengthen such favourable impression by every degree
of delicacy and attention to the suffering expectant, who imploring
assistance from the interposition of your art, hails you as
“the god of her idolatry,” by whom she is to receive an early
acquittal from all her sufferings.</p>

<p>As this is not often to be instantly expected, and many tedious
hours frequently intervene between the <em>hope</em> and <em>execution</em>, it will
be necessary (exclusive of your periodical consolations to the patient’s
inspiring resignation) you address yourself to the passions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
and foibles of the gossips, with whom you will in general be too
numerously attended, and whose clamours upon many occasions
are not easily to be subdued.—Notwithstanding this, the good
opinions and recommendations of these motley visitors (of all ages
and constitutions) are the very materials to form the foundation
of <em>report</em>, upon which the superstructure of your reputation and
future practice is to be raised.—Although <em>gravity</em>, even to a certain
degree of <em>solemnity</em>, is a characteristic of your professional practice,
yet there are times when you must unavoidably come forward to
enliven the <em>good ladies</em> with a specimen of your volubility, and
variegate the natural extremities of pain with the applicable insinuations
of mirth. Jocular inuendoes and double entendres are
not only expected, but courted in the intervals of ease, or, as the
good women generally term it, “when the business stands still.”</p>

<p>The introduction of the tea-table and the joke are always considered
equally promoters of mirth and the delivery; the practitioner
is expected to be well stocked with the most fashionable
recitals of <em>seduction</em>, <em>rapes</em>, <em>fornication</em>, and <em>adultery</em>, which, if well
told, and applicably introduced, insures him to a certainty the
future interests of his company. It will be absolutely necessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
you to fall into all the opinions of the table, except the glass of
brandy repeatedly pressed upon you by the <em>nurse</em> (as a specific,
or grand arcana, for every ill) with the very expressive plea of its
not doing you <em>any harm</em>; and “besides, Sir, what’s good for the
goose is good for the gander.”</p>

<p>After such casual respites (which frequently happen) when the
progress of labour calls you again to your <em>chair of office</em>, resume
the language of commiseration, giving your patient every alleviation
of hope for a speedy deliverance, at the very time you are impressing
(by significant looks and emphatic gestures) the attendants
and friends with an idea of great difficulty and impending danger.
In the alternate moments of respiration, evade every retrospective
allusion to the length of the labour, by frequent insinuations that
it advances rapidly, that you have great reason to hope every obstacle
will be soon surmounted; but you are afraid the consolation
you administer, and the pain she suffers, will take but little hold
of the memory, if you may be permitted to judge from the declaration
of a very pretty woman you delivered during your attendance
at the Lying-in Hospital, who, in reply to your tender
admonitions of fortitude and patience, said, “She was very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
obliged to you for your kindness, but she was very certain it would
be just the same again by <em>that time twelvemonth</em>.”—This will
make way for any thing applicable of your own collection, but
they must be all bordering upon the original cause of the scene
before you; for although the patient is in extreme pain, it is not
so with the attendants; they consider it a <em>matter of course</em>, and feel
no disgust but from fatigue, which they very justly conceive they
have a right to alleviate with occasional mirth—tea, and a <em>little
good brandy</em>.</p>

<p>To the <em>nurse</em>, great part of your attention must be directed;
for she, like a bellows blower to the organist at a cathedral, will
expect to be included and constitute <em>WE</em> in all the merit of your
execution.—The rapidity, or gradual progress of labour, at length
closes your complicated scene of mirth and anxiety; you deliver
your patient, and proceed to the subsequencies (<em>secundem artem</em>)
all which having concluded to general admiration, and received
ten thousand thanks and blessings from your subject, you convey
a pecuniary <em>hope</em> for future services into the hand of the <em>nurse</em>, take
a tender leave of your patient, with a promise of seeing her again
in proper time, drop an attracting <em>nod</em> of obedience to the sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>rounding
females, and meeting the husband at the bottom of the
stairs, congratulate him upon his son or his daughter; slightly
hint the difficulty of the case, the danger you apprehended, the
fatigue you had undergone, all which is not worthy a thought,
<em>perfectly happy</em> in an event that contributes so largely to the happiness
of him and his family.</p>

<p>That part of the work being completed, that most depended
upon the efforts of <em>Nature</em>, it becomes your duty to promote your
own interest by every exertion of <em>art</em>. Should, after your departure,
any <em>hemorrage</em> ensue, inevitable danger will be apprehended,
the patient will be reduced, the friends alarmed, and you,
in the moments of dreadful anxiety, be immediately sent for; this
<em>lucky circumstance</em> will operate to your earnest wish; it will afford
ample scope for your most fertile invention, and happily introduce
a long list of <em>styptics</em>, <em>anodynes</em>, and all those necessary concomitants
that give a profitable complexion to the business, by enlarging
your hopes, protracting the case, and encreasing the danger.</p>

<p>However, should this favourable circumstance not occur, your
privilege is by no means curtailed; you immediately commence
your previous intentional operation of dispatching a <em>sufficiency</em> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
<em>balsamic anodyne</em> draughts, “to promote and mitigate the severity
of <em>after pains</em>, that very much distress the patient.” These
draughts should be continued every <em>four hours at least</em>, and as a sufficient
quantity of that excellent (and cheap) medicine, <em>spermacæti</em>,
cannot be well dissolved in each draught, without rendering
it too viscid in consistence, it will be peculiarly advantageous to
you (as well as the patient) to let them be accompanied with
<em>boluses</em> to be taken at the <em>same time</em>, composed of <em>pulv. sperma</em>—<em>confect.
alkermes</em>, &amp;c.—Let the administration of these medicines be
entirely regulated by the temper, docility, and recovery of your
subject; having it ever in mind, that it is neither your duty or
interest to make the least observation upon their being no longer
necessary, till their frequent use is complained of by the patient
sufferer; and even then you are favoured by fortune in a plea,
that you “are now under the absolute necessity of making unavoidable
alterations for the prevention of the <em>milk, or puerperal</em>
fever, which you very much apprehend may ensue.” That it
is an invariable rule with you, never to recommend the use of
medicines, but where they are highly necessary; in the present
instance, it is your duty, from the motive of <em>gratitude</em>, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
equally circumspect, for the promotion of <em>her health</em> and your <em>own
reputation</em>.</p>

<p>To effect every desirable purpose, a gentle <em>diaphoresis</em> must be
supported, to prevent obstructions and promote the necessary
excretions; to procure which, you must entreat most earnestly
an implicit obedience to your directions, which from a variety
of <em>unpleasant symptoms</em> becomes indispensible. To carry which
point in a still greater degree, renew, at every visit, your attentions
to the <em>nurse</em> (who in your absence is a vortex of knowledge,
in your presence all obedience) her approbation of your conduct,
and good opinion of your practice must be obtained <em>at any price</em>;
it becomes with you a consideration of greater magnitude than
your patient’s recovery; for should <em>death</em> no longer permit <em>her</em>
presence in the scene of sublunary events, you lose <em>one patient only</em>;
but with the good opinion and recommendation of the <em>nurse</em>, vanishes
hundreds of patients <em>in embryo</em>, to be brought forth by the
influence of her exaggerated reports of your incredible abilities.</p>

<p>The nurse once secured and attached to your interest, becomes
an admirable instrument for the promotion of all your designs, she
embraces every opportunity to strengthen your directions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
urges (as you have done) the continuation of medicine, “till,
with the blessing of God, her mistress is quite set up and
upon her legs again.” A proper reflection upon these subjects
will convince you (even in the infancy of your embarkation)
that a <em>midwifery case</em> in a <em>good</em> family is no <em>bad</em> thing, and
made the most of, with the occasional aid of perpetual <em>cardiacs</em>,—<em>balsamics</em>,—<em>carminatives</em>,
and <em>anodynes</em>, to ease and “quiet the
child,” every time it <em>coughs, or belches</em>, constitutes a harvest
of industry and political necessity, that the world in general
is very little acquainted with.</p>

<p>Previous to the closing of the curtain, you have still an additional
chance for more depredations upon the unfortunate
husband; should <em>stagnant</em> milk occasion a <em>coagulum</em> in the <em>lacteals</em>,
constituting a <em>turgency</em> of the breasts, threatening a formation
of matter, <em>suppuration</em> becomes almost unavoidable, and you
promote it accordingly; this leads to <em>certain operation</em>, daily
dressings, &amp;c. all tend to encrease your interest, and give you
the enjoyment of a temporary monopoly in the joint practice
of <em>midwifery</em>, <em>surgery</em>, and <em>physic</em>.</p>

<p>The varieties of your past, as well as the personal requisites
for your future destination, are of such a pantomimic
and party-coloured complexion, that I cannot proceed
to a recital so truly risible, without first offering you, in the
lines of Woty, a predominant trait in my <em>own character</em>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I love to laugh, though Care stand frowning bye,</div>
<div class="verse">And pale Misfortune rolls her meagre eye.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus happily disposed to those brilliant sallies of mirth, that
almost renovate life, and set melancholy at defiance, you will
be the less liable to surprise, that I shall descend to the very
minutiæ of your necessary qualifications, for the support of so
arduous and complicated a character as you are now going to
perform upon the theatre of life.</p>

<p>It is very natural to conclude you have, during the tedious
years of initiation as an apprentice, and your more mature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
services as a journeyman, (politely ycleped assistant) whether in
the metropolis, or the country, gone through every degree of
drudgery, and feelingly experienced every indignity, that <em>insolent
pride</em> could bestow, or <em>patient merit</em> receive. Not an inferior
trust (of the inferior part of the faculty) but you have carried
into execution, from the injection of an <em>enema</em> in a garret, to
the separation of an <em>emplastrum vesicatorium</em> in a workhouse.
These are offices of humanity and service to your fellow
creatures, that do you immortal honour; they are retrospectives
that form an epoch in the mind of every practitioner, and
afford him the powerful consolation of <em>sacred truth</em>, “He that
humbleth himself,” &amp;c. by which rule, and the force of a
fertile imagination, any <em>apothecary</em> may <em>conceive</em> himself a <em>physician</em>,
even in the administration of a <em>glyster</em>. In this hospitable
execution (taken metaphorically) there cannot be supposed the
least indignity; for it is universally known the <em>greatest</em> and
most <em>prudent</em> generals are in the <em>rear</em> during the heat of battle;
and we are again taught seriously to believe “the last shall be
first,” &amp;c. so that you have every way, (by both <em>faith</em> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
<em>services</em>) insured a religious and prophetic <em>hope</em> of preferment.</p>

<p>Having for many years encountered the <em>worst</em>, you are now
prepared for the <em>best</em>; and bidding adieu to the rigid rules of
austere masters, embark upon your own foundation, qualified
for every medical consultation, from the bedchamber of a
<em>duchess dowager</em> to the subterraneous residence of her <em>chairman</em>.
You have, at this period, not only shaken off the shackles
of servitude, but the very recollection of your long standing
culinary connections. In your various changes of residence,
tedious peregrinations, and medical observations, it is natural
to conclude, you have acquired by care, study, and attention,
a competent knowledge of almost every tint in the picture of
life; which, with embellishments, derived from a few courses
under some of the <em>metropolitan lecturers</em>, and <em>hospital attendance</em>,
to qualify you for the complication of <em>country</em> practice, there is
no doubt but you come from the forge properly formed, to
make wrong appear right, and right wrong, in the face of every
<em>old woman</em> in the county where you are going to reside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>Exclusive of these qualifications, and the many instructions
already introduced under the two preceding heads (to which
you may occasionally refer) there are a great variety that must
be advanced for <em>your particular use</em>, and to those you will, no
doubt, pay every proper attention, if you indulge the least desire
to become a popular member of the faculty. In respect to
personal appearance, former distinctions and peculiarities are in
some degree levelled, the world is very much relaxed in its severities,
and the apothecary mixes with the general herd of
mankind, without those distinguishing exteriors that <em>were</em> his
professional characteristics. The gilt-headed cane and enormous
tassel are no longer in use; the <em>full-bottom wig</em>, that so universally
ornamented the <em>os frontis</em> of the faculty in general, is now
almost laid aside with inferior classes, and engrossed by the <em>college</em>.
The apothecary (particularly in the country) is in every
respect free from the illiberal censure of former times, and
treading close upon the heels of the <em>parson</em> and the <em>lawyer</em>, enjoys,
without restraint, the <em>chace</em>, the <em>gun</em>, the <em>bottle</em>, and <em>bona-roba</em>.
These, if you are of a volatile disposition and amorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
constitution, afford (at seasonable opportunities) a happy and
high relished relaxation from the many severities of medical
practice.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon your intended spot for embarkation, let
every thought be employed to display an attracting uniformity
in the disposition of your apparatus, for the <em>claptrap</em> of public
approbation; and though that great investigator of human nature
has beautifully portrayed “<em>a beggarly account of empty boxes</em>,”
yet they become immediately necessary to your present purpose;
it not being his business to explain the folly and extravagance
of your placing any thing of consequence there, before
you was experimentally convinced you should have occasion
for its use. Let there be a <em>profusion of appearance</em>; the <em>shell</em>
of a shop is not very expensive, and druggists are so numerous,
that you may be expeditiously supplied whenever circumstances
require it.—The bottles (being transparent) become more immediately
in need of <em>something</em> in each, particularly a few of
those articles (as hartshorn, lavender, &amp;c.) that are in common
request. The lower drawers (within reach) may be labelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
with <em>obsolete titles</em>, and in each placed various paper parcels of
<em>bran</em> or <em>saw-dust</em>, to avoid a chance of the sarcasm upon the faculty
by a countryman, who happened to be left alone some
time in the shop of an apothecary, and whose curiosity being
excited by the great <em>number of drawers</em>, was powerfully
prompted to open one labelled “<em>Thus</em>,” which finding <em>empty</em>,
he was induced to try a second, <em>still the same</em>; a third, <em>the same
also</em>.—Oh! oh! says he, “I see plain enough how it is, they
are all <em>Thus</em>.” Your shop being at length finished in a stile
modern and striking, let a green silk curtain (with brass rods
and rings) be affixed to your window; it is an excellent method
of conveying an idea of internal mystery, and inspiring proportionate
external curiosity. Let no paltry diffidence appear in the
board over your door, announcing your name and qualifications;
there are great numbers that can’t distinguish <em>small
letters</em> at a distance, to avoid which inconvenience, let the capitals
be as conspicuous as the canvas figures at a country
puppet-shew.</p>

<p>“Thus far before the wind;” and being (as it is natural to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
conclude) not greatly engaged, it becomes your immediate
attention to wait personally upon the different overseers of the
surrounding parishes, and give them most forcibly to understand,
they have been for many years the subjects of imposition;
but you having more <em>honesty</em> than the whole body of
the faculty, will undertake to <em>farm</em> the medical superintendance
of the <em>poor</em>, at half the annual sum it has ever cost the inhabitants
before. This political stroke will excellently answer
both your purposes, for overseers in general care not how little
they pay; and you being professionally callous to the tears of
poverty and distress, care not how little you give for their
money.</p>

<p><em>Tartar emetic</em>—<em>Pulv. contray.</em> c.—<em>Pulv. nitri</em>, and <em>Pulv. jalapii</em>—are
medicines admirably calculated for the constitutions of the
poor; and thirty or forty shillings a year in those articles, will
be sufficient for the consumption of <em>five</em> or <em>six</em> parishes; with the
additional advantage of rendering <em>vials</em> unnecessary, a consideration
of some consequence, when it is remembered they are
now double their former price. These parochial connections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
will be productive of advantage in more ways than one, for
as the unhappy paupers will be constantly seen at your door,
it will afford all the appearance of sudden popularity.</p>

<p>Ostentatious parade, and personal consequence, must be
your leading traits, and never lost sight of; <em>a couple of horses</em>
will contribute largely to these objects; not that you are expected
to degrade the dignity of your profession, by riding,
like Hughes or Astley, <em>two at a time</em>, but their appearance
will constitute an admirable shew of business in being rode
<em>alternately</em>; and as most young men who have not been long
their own masters, are fond of displaying their persons on
the <em>outside of a horse</em>, you may exultingly not only “feed fat”
the propensity, but the general run of your mechanical
neighbours (who see no farther than the tips of their noses,
and are ever caught by appearances) will erroneously suppose
you are visiting some of the first characters in the county.
As it will be now highly derogatory for you to stain
your hands with any menial services, procure speedily a <em>jour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>neyman</em>
(alias assistant) to enhance your own weight; if there
is at present nothing for him to do, the curtain, before recommended,
will obscure his indolence from the prying eye
of public curiosity.</p>

<p>No part of the faculty having ever been remarkable for
the regularity or fervency of their <em>devotions</em>, your presence at
church will consequently not be expected (particularly after
the impressions you have made of being perpetually engaged)
unless you politically appear there at two or three different
times, merely for the convenience of being called out <em>by your
own direction</em>, at the still and most awful part of the service;
a circumstance that will tell much to your advantage with
every superannuated <em>old woman</em> in the parish. Take particular
care that your horse is constantly brought to your door
on the sabbath day, just as the neighbours are passing to
church, and there paraded some time previous to your appearance,
which to every weak mind will have its effects;
and be equally careful to measure the steps of your <em>horse</em>, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the hands of your <em>watch</em>, so that whether your journey is accidentally
long, or intentionally short, you return just at the
moment of their dismission from the religious conventicle.
In passing the whole body of inhabitants, be strictly careful
of your self consequence—a bow of <em>significant respect</em> to two
or three of the <em>superiors</em>, may be applicable and consistent—but
no familiarity with, or knowledge of, the multitude;
the greater your <em>ostentation</em> and <em>indifference</em>, the more <em>servile</em>
will be their <em>admiration</em> and <em>respect</em>.</p>

<p>By no means form any hasty or inconsiderate matrimonial
connection; you will derive many advantages at first from a life
of <em>celibacy</em>; there are always a variety of juvenile females in
the country (as well as the metropolis) who considering themselves
<em>every way qualified</em> to constitute <em>doctor’s ladies</em>, will most
industriously <em>throw</em> themselves in your way upon every occasion,
that their personal attractions may not escape your observation.
To families where there are daughters, nieces, or
cousins, who <em>conceive</em> themselves ripe for the <em>gordian knot</em>, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
may assure yourself of being called in a short time; for as
you are such “a charming man” in your appearance, (and
so admirably <em>fitting</em> for a husband) there can’t be the least
reason to doubt your professional qualifications.</p>

<p>You may perhaps start some doubts, (or conscientious
qualms may arise) how these appearances are to be supported
in the infancy of business, without any great personal property
to sanction or justify the attempt; in such diffidence
you perfectly display, not only your pusillanimity, but want
of knowledge and experience; for certainly out of the above
description of females, who will constantly pay court to your
consequence, and by a <em>thousand modes</em> solicit your attention,
surely some one of the <em>best possessions</em> may be obtained, whose
<em>fortune</em>, and advantage of family connection, may answer your
most sanguine expectations: but should <em>fate</em> conspire against
you in both <em>business and marriage</em>, you will have the consolation
of having made <em>a bold push</em>, and failing in the attempt,
you only become a fashionable adventurer, and gratefully
pay your creditors <em>nothing in the pound</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>Having gone through a chain of circumstances and instructions,
necessary for the support of your <em>public</em> appearance,
it will be naturally expected I shall revert to the modes
of behaviour that are to constitute your <em>private</em> character, in
the professional transactions that you conclude will daily occur.
First, let it be your constant observance to be equally
reserved and difficult of access—whenever your opinion is
required, even in your own shop, appear there with tedious
reluctance, as if privacies of the utmost consequence prevented
your earlier attendance; this will not only add to your medical
weight, but raise your reputation for <em>good breeding</em> and
intercourse with the polite world; for it is universally known,
none but the inferior orders are introduced to each other
without ceremony; it would be therefore highly ridiculous in
you to practise a mode of behaviour in use only with the
lowest classes of mankind.</p>

<p>Never leave home without letting your horse be held long
enough at the door to be observed by the surrounding neigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>bours;
the most trifling indication of business is a point in
your favour, and ought by no means to be omitted. By
the invariable good effect of which rule, no messenger whatever
should arrive from the country for medicines, but he
must be detained <em>as long as possible</em>; his preparations should
never be ready when called for; on the contrary, his horse
should be hung or held at the door for half an hour at least;
a double advantage is derived from this necessary caution—the
horse at the door will prove a striking object to the public,
and the messenger will assure the family you attend, that,
nothing but your great hurry occasioned the delay in his
return.</p>

<p>It will be strictly proper for you, upon all occasions, to
preserve the most inflexible serenity of countenance, even to
extreme gravity; and this injunction becomes the more immediately
necessary, as there are a vast variety of unexpected
causes for laughter, to which you will be open, in the frequent
applications of unpolished rustics, for your <em>great opinion</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and assistance. One class will “beg the favour of you to <em>subscribe</em>
for their complaints;” another “hopes you won’t be
offended, but he is come to <em>insult</em> you upon his case;” these
instances are so exceedingly common, that you will often
meet with them, where they are least expected. There now
lives <em>an alderman</em>, in a very capital town and place of <em>royal
residence</em>, who, a few years since, labouring under an <em>epidemic</em>
complaint, was told that symptoms were alarming, and a
<em>glyster</em> was unavoidably necessary; to which representation he
expostulated, begging the apothecary “to lay aside his intention,
and give him any thing to <em>take inwardly</em>, but for
<em>God’s sake</em>, to have no <em>cutting</em> and <em>slaying</em>.”—Another of the
same <em>learned body corporate</em> (for they have both kissed the
K—g’s hand) said “he bore the severity of his complaint
with more patience, now he was <em>manured</em> to it.”</p>

<p>To prove the frequency of these accidental slips, it is impossible
to resist the present temptation of introducing a few
more, that occur to memory in the present recital. A lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
upon the borders of Northamptonshire, being sent in the
night to a medical practitioner at Banbury, and calling him
out of bed, told him, “he must come immediately to his
mistress, for she had got a <em>Vistula</em>!”——“Where? <em>In
ano?</em>” “No, Zir, in the next parish to’t.”</p>

<p>In an excursion to Surrey, I was solicited in a parish near
Chertsey, to give my advice to a master carpenter there, who
had been a long time indisposed; but my prescription having
had the desired effect, and the poor man getting abroad,
he very gratefully declared to all his friends, “I was the <em>best
musician</em> that ever came into the country.”—In the county
of Berks, an elderly woman came to consult me upon the
bad state of her daughter’s health; and after animadverting
upon symptoms, told me <em>in a whisper</em>, “that her daughter
was to have been married to a young man some time
since; but something happening to break it off, she really
believed <em>’twas nature turned inward in her</em>.”</p>

<p>Paying a visit, in my earlier days, to the lady of a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
old country alderman of a borough in Hertfordshire, she,
after many aukward apologies for the indelicacy of the subject,
tremblingly told me, “she had been very uneasy for
some days, with a violent heat in her <em>firmament</em>.”—By way of
suppressing those risible emotions in my disposition I have before
described, I, for a moment, changed the subject, by enquiring
the health of her husband; to which she replied, with
thanks, “he was exceedingly well, but gone to make an
<em>exerescence</em> into the country;” plunged deeper in difficulty,
and nearer the <em>laugh</em> than before, which was now become
hard to suppress, I applied myself to her snuff-box, then on
the table, and passing a few encomiums on its neatness, she
said, it was very much admired, being a <em>gypsey’s pimple</em> set in
<em>pinch-gut</em>.</p>

<p>You will, no doubt, be now prepared for such unexpected
misapplication of words, such <em>sublimity of expression</em>,
and regulate the rigidity of your <em>frontal</em> muscles accordingly;
when called to a patient, let your personal address and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
behaviour be modelled entirely by the state of his <em>property</em>;
if he is <em>your superior</em> in rank and condition, every action of
yours must denote it most strikingly;—you <em>approach</em> with
<em>respect</em>—you <em>dictate</em> with <em>submission</em>—your mildness and <em>affected
penetration</em> must be perceptible in all your enquiries, making
the most scrupulous observations how far you seem to gain
upon the <em>credulity</em> and good opinion of your subject, taking
leave with all those attracting expressions of tenderness and
sympathy, (highly tinctured with respect) that may give
your patient a favourable idea of the <em>integrity</em>, it can never
be your <em>interest</em> to possess.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when your advice and assistance is required
to a patient, whose feelings are equally wounded by
bodily affliction and the barbed arrow of adversity, you may
safely reverse the whole mode of behaviour, and put into
practice your personal pride, even to perfect impudence.
This will be in many respects a consistency of conduct; it
will be convincing them, as you have nothing to hope from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
their <em>affluence</em>, you have certainly nothing to fear from their
<em>poverty</em>.</p>

<p>Let what will be the condition of your patient, you are
not to act as some few conscientious practitioners do, explaining
what you conceive to be the nature of the case,
original cause of complaint, or from what operation you
expect expeditious relief; this may be the best practice with
those unfashionable formal old fellows, who received their
medical instructions near half a century since, and pique
themselves upon what they call their <em>integrity</em>; but it will be
perfectly <em>illiberal</em> in you, who have received a more modern,
and polished education. Ambiguity, and true medical mystery,
will be your best guide upon every occasion; by not
naming the case, or <em>cause of complaint</em>, you can never be accused
of having <em>mistaken</em> it; and by letting the property of
the medicine you administer remain a matter of secrecy with
all but yourself, you reserve the incontrovertible power of
saying, “it has had the <em>very effect</em> you <em>intended</em>,” whether it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
operates by <em>vomit</em>, <em>stool</em>, <em>urine</em>, <em>perspiration</em>, or <em>sleep</em>: these are
precautions a <em>wise</em> man always takes, a <em>fool</em> never, and may
be deemed something similar to the conduct of Bayes’s
troops in the Rehearsal, who, the <em>warlike</em> messenger said,
“were stealing a march in <em>stilts</em>.”</p>

<p>During the indisposition of your patient, ’tis your duty
to think much more of the emolument that will arise from
the <em>protraction</em> of his case, than the <em>expedience</em> of his cure.
You must have it ever in mind, that he has paid you the
the greatest compliment one man can possibly pay another
on earth; he has placed an implicit confidence, and entrusted
you with the care of his constitution and the key of his cash;
in fact, he has put both his <em>life</em> and <em>property</em> into your hands;
and the respect you owe to <em>self-preservation</em> renders it necessary
you make the most of <em>both</em>. Let your attachment to his
health and interest be demonstrated by the frequency of your
attendance; it will be impossible for you to give a greater
proof of your <em>disinterested</em> friendship, than by your large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and constant supplies of different medicines; too great a
quantity, too great a variety cannot be introduced; they all
tend to a promotion of your emolument, and the sum total
of your bill will be considered <em>a striking proof</em> of your <em>merit</em>
and assiduity.</p>

<p>If you find the family and friends not perfectly satisfied
with your conduct, that there is the least coolness and discontent
perceptible, or symptoms of present or approaching danger,
strongly recommend the presence of a <em>better opinion</em> in
the form of a physician; this will prove an exertion of the
soundest policy—double the quantity of medicines will be
thrown into <em>his</em> prescription for the promotion of <em>your</em> interest,
an act that the present danger will amply justify, and
should the unhappy victim be doomed</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To pass that bourne,</div>
<div class="verse">From whence no traveller returns,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You have nobly and skilfully slipped your neck out of the
collar, and left all the credit of <em>killing</em> (as you really ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
do) to your superior, whose <em>diploma</em> entitles him to the preference;
and, <em>vice versa</em>, should you perceive the patient and
family become dupes to your affected sincerity, and that you
are daily raising yourself in their estimation, erect a structure
of professional applause upon the basis of their <em>credulity</em>; insinuate
every possible degree of self praise, and set the advice
of a physician in the most contemptible point of view.—Affect
unlimited attachment to the interest of your patient, and
say, “you would recommend much better advice than your
own, if you could do it with a conscientious consistency; but
it had ever been an opinion of yours (which was still unaltered)
if the apothecary could not plunder a family <em>sufficiently</em>,
the better method would be to adopt <em>a consultation</em>, when it
might be done to a <em>certainty</em>.”</p>

<p>This open manner of dealing instantly enhances you in the
estimation of patient and friends, and you will consequently
stand so high in opinion that you may proceed deliberately
in your <em>spoils</em> without interruption, for where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
are no <em>daily fees</em> (swallowed up in the <em>vortex</em> of the college)
your more trifling depredations will not be considered as
matters of medical magnitude or imposition.</p>

<p>In all kinds of inferior practice render every look, every
thought and action, subservient to your general intent of
personal rank and pecuniary consequence; it must be your
particular study to inculcate every idea in the lower class, of
your great penetration and abilities; by your minute investigations,
cross-examinations, and applicable nods of significance
(implying the most extensive knowledge) you will discover
remote symptoms, that once explained to the complaining
patient, will give them reason to believe (which they very
readily do) you are a supernatural agent; and one <em>fool</em> of <em>this
denomination</em>, who firmly believes you know the state of his
health by the <em>wrinkles</em> in his <em>forehead</em>, or the <em>cloud</em> in his <em>urine</em>,
will soon infect a whole county with the certainty of your infallible
qualifications. This opinion once founded, the effect
is absolutely incredible, an instance of which may be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
in various parts of England, but more particularly in a very
large and populous town, not forty miles west of the metropolis,
where <em>fools</em> from every part of the county are constantly
driving (their pockets laden with <em>chamber-lye</em>) to a
famous inspector of <em>urinals</em>, vulgarly denominated a <em>piss-pot
doctor</em>, who, to magnify the report of his incredible skill and
penetration, has adopted a certain method to impose upon
the minds of the multitude, and prey upon the little pecuniary
collections they can make, to become the dupes of <em>his
villainy</em> and their own <em>infatuation</em>.</p>

<p>The mode of imposition, I shall explain in a fact as communicated
by one of his most intimate friends, and leave the
story itself to applaud his ingenuity:—He has (in a very respectable
habitation) a small private room, to which every patient
or messenger is conducted (upon a plea that the <em>doctor</em>
is not at home, or is particularly engaged) here an emissary
(as if casually) asking certain questions, hears the whole
story, examines the urine, and descends to particulars—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
<em>doctor</em> is in the adjoining apartment (calculated by a thin partition
and certain openings, invisible to the unsuspecting visitor)
where he minutely hears the entire conversation; the
necessary secrets being obtained, he makes his appearance
with the most commanding aspect; at this awful ceremony,
the fascinated patient almost feels the effect of <span class="smcap">ANIMAL MAGNETISM</span>;
the approach of so much wisdom deprives him for a
moment of speech, and the <em>poor devil</em> undergoes a kind of
temporary annihilation. An instance of this occurred not long
since, when a country fellow having journeyed twelve miles
to the doctor with a bottle of his wife’s <em>chrystal stream</em>, communicated
the necessary particulars to the agent, when the
doctor, in possession of the secret, made his appearance.—“Well,
friend!”—“I have brought your honour my wife’s
water, she could not <em>rest any longer</em> without your <em>device</em>.”—“Your
wife’s water—very well—let me see!—aye, I
perceive she has <em>bruised her shoulder</em>.”—“Yes, Sir, she has
indeed.”—“By this water (it is perfectly clear) she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
<em>fallen down stairs</em>.”—“Yes, your honour!”—“She is not
injured in any other part by the fall?”—“Only complains
a little at the <em>bottom of her belly</em>, your honour.”—“Well,
she fell from the top of the stairs to the bottom, <em>I see</em>?”—“No,
your honour, she had gone down two steps before she
fell.”—“Indeed! why then you have not brought me <em>all
her water</em>.”—“No, your honour, there was <em>a little</em> the
bottle would not hold.”—“Why then, sirrah, the <em>two
stairs</em> are left behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>.“——This circumstance, (of a thousand
that might be quoted) is sufficient to demonstrate the
ridiculous credulity of the multitude in all matters of quackery,
and leaves us to lament, that the ignorance of one class,
should become so wretched a prey to the deliberate villainy
of another.</p>

<p>The long experience you have had, in charging and posting
your accompts, under different masters of equal judgment
and experience, leaves little room for instruction under
that head; it may however not prove inapplicable to remind
you, it is no matter how incoherent or unintelligible the
<em>writing</em> is, provided your <em>figures</em> are <em>bold</em> and <em>conspicuous</em>; so
long as you can convince them how much they <em>have to pay</em>,
it is a total matter of indifference to you, how much they
have <em>received</em>.</p>

<p>There is one caution however exceedingly necessary to be
advanced, to prevent your becoming subject to a reproof
given by the celebrated Dean Swift to his apothecary, for
presuming to be handsomely paid for the confidence of putting
himself upon an equality with his superiors. This is
the impropriety of letting the word ”<em>visits</em>“ constitute a
part of your charge, instead of the more modest term of
”<em>journeys</em>,“ or ”<em>attendance</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>.“</p>

<p>The Dean having been afflicted with a long and severe fit
of illness, requested, soon after recovery, the apothecary’s
bill; which having perused, and finding a sum total very
much beyond his expectation, he proceeded to <em>dissection</em>, and
perceiving almost every <em>third article</em> to announce the honour
of a ”<em>visit</em>,” at five shillings each, he satirically adopted the
following plan to punish <em>Mr. Emetic</em>, for what the Dean considered
a piece of consummate assurance.—Having required
his attendance to receive his demand, he paid down a certain
sum of money, which the mortified apothecary continued to
tell over, and repeatedly compare with the figures denoting
the <em>sum total</em>; but still continuing <em>to tell and compare</em>, without
seeming to get at all nearer the point of satisfaction, the
Dean, in compassion to the confusion he visibly laboured under,
observed, as he did not seem to be perfectly clear in his
arrangement of the accompt, he would set him right.—If
he would but deduct the amount of the “visits” from the
sum total of his bill, he would find it exactly right; for
being now pretty well recovered, he intended <em>paying</em> him his
“<em>visits</em>” again <em>one at a time</em>.</p>

<p>You will now naturally conclude every instruction that can
be possibly necessary, has been submitted to your consideration,
for the promotion of your prosperous and profitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
career through the medical journey of life; it is not so; for
although we have gone through the usual forms of sickness,
to either recovery or death, there is still one remark necessary,
to the completion of consistency, in your professional
character. It is a few observations, in derision of that truly
contemptible burlesque upon propriety, in following the
corps of your patient to the grave; a folly originating in
<em>ignorance</em>, and established by <em>custom</em>; a circumstance so truly
ridiculous and farcical, that it did not escape the penetration
and sarcastic wit of our Aristophanes of the present century,
who attacked it with the full force of his satire, in the description
given by a taylor, in one of his celebrated comedies,
who says, “as he was going home to a customer with a pair
of breeches under his arm, he perceived his neighbour
<em>Gargle</em>, the apothecary, following a <em>corps</em> to the grave,—so
says he, Master Gargle, I see you are going home with
your <em>work too</em>.” The justice of this remark renders the
circumstance so truly ridiculous, that it is a matter of admi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>ration,
how any man of the most common understanding
can ever submit to an indignity so truly laughable. It certainly
bears the appearance of your not being content with
preying upon the property of the deceased, during their last
hours of sublunary affliction, but you meanly pursue their
very remains to the grave, and obtain a paltry hatband and
gloves, at the expence of decency and discretion. Exclusive
of this very striking obstacle, there is one of equal weight in
the scale of your professional reputation—it certainly can add
none to the eminence of your character, that the contents of
the coffin was publickly known to be a subject of your skill
and experimental practice.</p>

<p>You will certainly experience some difficulty in evading a
compliance with many requests, made to you for this purpose;
but I would recommend it to you to encounter displeasure,
rather than become the dupe of so great an absurdity.
To inculcate by example, what I have strongly recommended
in precept, you may be assured, that I have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
during my long practice, retained so great an aversion to this
inconsistency of character, that I rendered myself totally incapable
of compliance, by never having in possession <em>a suit of
mourning</em>; this resource has always proved my never failing
friend, when no other apology would be accepted; and by
never seeming to recollect <em>the want</em> till a few hours before the
<em>funeral</em>, a written apology has always proved a respectable
substitute, to which there was no alternative.</p>

<p>Having descended to the very minutiæ of a long, extensive,
and successful practice, to form your mind, and regulate
your manners in every professional transaction of your life,
I cannot doubt, but rules so directly consonant to your personal
interest and reputation, will receive every assistance from
your unerring consistency and perseverance, conveying a perfect
corroboration of the <em>gratitude</em> you feel, for the intrinsic
worth of so liberal and friendly a communication.</p>

THE CHYMISTS AND DRUGGISTS.</h2>


<p>It will create no surprise that you bring up the rear of
this medical exhibition, when it is remembered that the
most opulent, eminent, or respectable, generally close every
public procession.—You are to the faculty, what the <em>hammerman</em>
is to the <em>forge</em>; you are in fact the <em>arterial reservoir</em>, from
whose source flow the rich streams, that feed the <em>venal divisions</em>
in every branch of the profession, whether in town or country.
To the fertility of your genius, to the extent of your
commerce, to the enterprising spirit of your pecuniary embarkations,
the faculty are indebted for the great variety
and striking novelties, that render them so much the subjects
of admiration.</p>

<p>You happily derive your affluence from dealing innocently
around you the various <em>instruments</em> of <em>death</em>, with an in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>difference
that sufficiently exculpates you from the suspicion
of <em>murder</em>, even as accessaries before the fact.—Your constant,
and extensive inventions (for the promotion of private emolument
and public good) rank you high in general estimation,
and you prudently recommend yourselves to the attention of
the most learned, by your very <em>frequent</em> and <em>extraordinary</em> discoveries.—Your
advertisements (with which almost every
literary vehicle teems) are alike calculated to excite wonder
and approbation; they seem to indicate proofs, that <em>you alone</em>
exceed the limits of human penetration, and display a hope
of perpetual existence, by setting mortality at defiance; like a
groupe of <em>desperate hazard players</em>, you are “at all in the
ring,” and with a degree of emulative opposition to each
other, produce from your <em>alembics</em>—<em>bolt heads</em>, and <em>balneum
arenæs</em>, antidotes to every ill: the only ray of consolation to
the less learned is, that <em>death</em> (often an unexpected visitor)
opens the eyes of the world to the arts of your deception,
and you slide into the grave with the calm and unobserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
obscurity of your neighbours. The wonderful extent of your
fertile abilities are constantly conveyed to public attention,
through the pompous medium of “Letters Patent” and
“Royal Authority,” that are at length become (from the
higher arts) the fashionable introduction to a <em>breeches ball</em>; a
<em>tincture for the tooth ach</em>; a <em>blacking cake</em>, or a <em>gamboge horse ball</em>.</p>

<p>While I lament this degradation, this prostitution of patronage,
to such <em>trifling</em>, such <em>contemptible</em> efforts of <em>sterility</em>, I
cannot but consider how gratefully, how extensively, you are
bound to a credulous and indulgent public, who implicitly
sanction with their patronage, every production of <em>genius or
dullness</em>, whether in a <em>philosophic taper</em>, a concentrated <em>acid of
vinegar</em>, or a <em>salt of lemons</em>; they are undoubtedly discoveries
of <em>immense magnitude</em> to the public at large; and experience
has sufficiently proved, that so much <em>patriotic virtue</em> should
meet its <em>own reward</em>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the superiority and extent of your knowledge,
so visibly displayed in the <em>sublimity</em> of your frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
experiments, that have raised you to such a great degree of
professional eminence, there may yet be some profitable principles
of practice, inculcated by a long and studious observer,
that will evidently add to your emoluments, if not to the encrease
of your reputations.</p>

<p>Your <em>peculiar modesty</em> may have prevented your attaining
the utmost perfection of your art, and left you strangers to
the very great and undiscovered advantages, that the privileges
of your profession so singularly entitle you to; for
though you may hitherto have reconciled yourselves to a
paltry <em>mechanical</em> profit of thirty-five or forty per cent. what
law forbids you making the “most of your market,” and
enhancing those profits to such state, as may best accord with
your idea and gratification of <em>city eminence</em>—<em>rural ease</em>—<em>external
appearance</em>, and <em>domestic hospitality</em>? To insure these
comforts to a certainty, accept such instructions, (as closely
adhered to) will inevitably produce the purposes for which
they are introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Hitherto, a stranger to the happy effects of necessary
<em>adulteration</em>, it may not be inapplicable to say a few words
upon its numerous advantages; first, at your embarkation,
you should adopt it as the <em>ultimatum</em> of all your professional
views, and render it as subservient to your wishes, as the
lover’s invariable observance of “<em>persevere</em> and <em>conquer</em>,” is to
his. <em>Adulteration</em> has many pleasing advantages annexed to
its practice; by the applicable introduction of an <em>harmless</em> ingredient,
you may reduce the dangerous property of a
<em>drastic</em> purgative, and render a powerful <em>poison</em> less destructive;
by such acts you will enjoy the inexpressible consolation
of hourly contributing to the safety of your fellow-creatures,
in exertions of <em>humanity</em>, that will do you the
greatest honour.</p>

<p>The prelude to the <em>Pharmacopœia</em>, sufficiently informs you,
the <em>College of Wigs</em> are empowered by royal sanction to invent,
or constitute forms, and the <em>cabinet</em> to enforce them;
but your superior knowledge sets such arbitrary dictation at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
defiance, and your <em>practical arts</em> will ever supersede their
<em>theoretical</em> penetration. Let them happily enjoy the power to
alter names, and improve forms of all the compositions in
that <em>laughable farrago</em>, their <em>new dispensatory</em>; they have the
province to direct, and you have the pleasure to evade; obeying
their injunctions no farther than is strictly consistent with
your own interest and convenience. To assist the aptitude
of your fertility, let me introduce to your attention (as specimens
of what may be done) some few of the advantageous
alterations that may be made in medicinal composition, to
promote your certain emolument, without arraigning your
<em>integrity</em>.</p>

<p>In that expensive preparation <em>confectio cardiaca</em> (newly
named by college sagacity <em>confectio aromatica</em>) opportunity
offers to display a part of your privilege in substituting the
use of <em>saffron paper</em>, which will impart to the composition the
rich colour of the original <em>crocus</em>; for those other high priced
articles <em>cardamoms</em>, <em>cinnamon</em>, <em>nutmegs</em>, and <em>cloves</em>, applicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
and proportional quantities of those cheaper (and equally
efficacious) <em>cordials</em> and <em>carminatives</em>, <em>ginger</em>, <em>grains of paradise</em>,
or any of the inferior spices may be added. In large
preparations of the <em>electarium lenitivum</em>, an introduction of the
<em>pulp of prunes</em> for the <em>pulp of cassia</em>, will save much additional
expence and trouble.—In the <em>syrupus e spina cervina</em>, treacle
is certainly preferable to the finest lump sugar, with this advantage,
that the predominant nausea will prevent the discovery.</p>

<p>Experience will convince you that <em>spiritus c. c.</em> (<em>per se</em>)
obtained by distillation from the accumulated stale urine of a
parish workhouse, or the bones of animals, will be by far
preferable to that drawn from the purest <em>cornu cervi</em>; as are
the rasura c. c. from the shank bones of horses, or cows,
preferable to all other.—<em>Sp. terebinthinæ</em> (carefully and proportionally
incorporated) becomes an admirable associate
with the <em>ol. juniperi</em>.—<em>Ol. amygdalinum</em> (and many other articles
blended <em>secundum artem</em>) form an excellent combination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
with, and increase the stock of <em>ol. anisi verum</em>.—<em>Genuine gum
guaiacum</em>—<em>galbanum</em>—<em>storax</em>, and <em>bals. tolutanum</em>, may undergo
the process of <em>purification</em> much better, if impregnated with
the occasional assistance of either the <em>resina nigra</em>, or <em>flava</em>.—The
various unguents will derive advantage from the salutary
introduction of <em>auxungiæ porcincæ</em>, as a substitute for those
more <em>expensive and unnecessary</em> articles <em>cera flava</em> and <em>ol. olivarum</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pulv. anisi verum</em> will be much more easily reduced from the
cakes, after the seed has been expressed, the oil obtained, and
their medical virtue entirely extracted; it is an article only
in use for horses and cows; whether they are <em>killed or cured</em>, is
an object not worthy your consideration. <em>Liquorice</em>, <em>fenugreek</em>,
<em>diapente</em>, <em>turmeric</em>, and <em>elecampane</em>, are to receive their basis
from <em>horse beans</em> ground (at the medical mills) exceedingly
fine, and to be impregnated properly with the different articles
from which they derive their names, so as to retain each
their predominant effluvia; and as these are articles in use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
for cattle only, you will give proof of your humanity, by
drenching them with <em>food</em> instead of <em>physic</em>. The species <em>hiera</em>
will be much more certain in its effects, if prepared with the
<em>Barbadoes</em>, instead of the <em>Succotrine</em> aloes; and the true Dutch
biscuit powder, will form no unprofitable union with the powder
of <em>Salop</em>. In fact, innumerable instances of professional
skill and œconomy might be introduced, extending instructions
to a much greater length than originally intended;
protracting the explanatory parts beyond the limits of utility,
an accusation it has been my principal care to avoid.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be almost unnecessary to remind you, how
absolutely needful it will be, to reduce to impalpable pulverization
and complicated forms, all inferior and damaged
<em>drugs</em> of every denomination; in <em>powders</em>, <em>tinctures</em>, <em>electuaries</em>,
and other preparations, their defects will not be perceptible,
and it will prove matter of no small gratification to you, that
many practitioners are very <em>inferior judges</em> of the compositions
they constantly prescribe; to these may be added the still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
greater number, that never condescend to undergo the task
of inspection, forming together a major part of the very numerous
and respectable body I have undertaken to instruct.—If
you are a dispenser of <em>chemicals</em> and <em>galenicals</em> by retail,
one additional observation will prove worthy your attention—never
let your shop, or dispensary, get into disrepute by
too much modesty, in saying you are without the most obsolete
or ridiculous article that can be enquired for; if <em>oil of
swallows</em>, <em>oil of bricks</em>, <em>lobsters’ blood</em>, or <em>milk of lilies</em>, should be
the objects in request, let the fertility of your invention <em>instantly</em>
furnish a substitute for either; of these, such a great
variety are always to be found, the least enumeration becomes
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The series of instructions advanced for the promotion of
professional interest, have been promulgated without a fear
of offence, or hope of reward; amidst the very great number
of different practitioners, into whose hands these admonitions
must inevitably fall, happy he who can exultingly exclaim,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>
“Let the gall’d jade wince, our withers are unwrung.”<br />
</p>

<p>From the physician, who lingers out a life of <em>studious suspense</em>,
and derives a scanty subsistence from the alternate labour of
morning visits and evening lectures—from that <em>dignified</em>
“member of the corporation,” whole <em>mercurial</em> abilities are
thrust into the hand of every dirty passenger, in the more
dirty avenues of the metropolis—from that industrious <em>accoucher</em>,
whose incessant nocturnal labour renders him, in
common life, little superior to the <em>nightman</em>, and that equal
drudge the metropolitan <em>pharmacopolist</em>, I can have little to
expect but universal denunciation of vengeance, and threats
of malevolence: to the effect of these, I oppose the stability
of <em>truth</em>, that will render me <em>invulnerable</em> to all their attacks.</p>

<p>A steady observance of the iniquity of medical practice
has long since powerfully convinced me of the absolute necessity
of professional reformation, and should I (by arming
the public with a weapon of self-defence) succeed in producing
a change in the systematic imposition of one, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
preventing perpetual depredation upon the other, every idea
of personal ambition will be fully gratified, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“So little slave to what the world calls fame;</div>
<div class="verse">As dies my body—so I wish my name.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But this obscurity in the present instance is much more anxiously
to be <em>hoped</em> than <em>expected</em>, for there cannot be the least
doubt entertained but <em>some one</em> of his Majesty’s ministers (who
are ever anxious for the public good and increase of revenue)
will, through the medium of the publisher, discover the joint
secret of <em>name</em> and <em>residence</em>, that by placing the author in the
<span class="smcap">TREASURY</span>, <span class="smcap">CUSTOMS</span>, or some office equally lucrative, they
may avail themselves of his <span class="smcap">INTEGRITY</span>, not hesitating a moment
to believe, that so just an investigator of professional
impositions upon individuals, must unavoidably render the
<span class="smcap">STATE</span> adequate service, in the discovery of official depredations
upon the <span class="smcap">PUBLIC</span>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
